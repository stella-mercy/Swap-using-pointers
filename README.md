# Swap-using-pointers
Swapping of values of variables by using pointers is a great example of calling functions by call by reference. Functions can be called in two ways:

Call by Value Call by reference In call by value, a copy of actual arguments is passed to formal arguments of the called function. Any change made to the formal arguments in the called function has no effect on the values of actual arguments in the calling function.

In call by reference method, the address of the actual parameter is passed into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument. Any changes made to the formal parameters are also made to the actual parameters, since the changes are being made to the same location in memory
